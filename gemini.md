# MEGA Project Technical Implementation Plan: ECG Didactic Module

## 1. General Vision and Project Objectives

This project aims to create an advanced medical education web platform for trained general practitioners seeking to specialize in specific topics. The proposal is to develop a modular and highly customizable "mega site" that delivers in-depth content in different medical areas, interactively and dynamically.

The development strategy will follow a multi-MVP (Minimum Viable Product) model, meaning that independent but integrated modules will be launched, each representing an MVP focused on a specific subject (e.g., Hemodynamics, Neurointensivism, etc.), allowing for incremental evolution and content addition.

The central objective is to provide in-depth and progressive learning, dedicating ample time to each module to fully cover the topic before moving on to the next. At the same time, the platform will serve as a showcase for modern educational technologies, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in both content generation/updating and user interaction, making education computational and machine-assisted.

In short, we are looking for an advanced, applicable, broad, and robust project that can grow over time and incorporate continuous improvements through AI.

## 2. Modular Architecture and Multi-MVP Approach

Each medical topic will be developed as an autonomous module, almost like its own micro-site, but all will be united under the same platform. This modularization allows each module to have its own development and content lifecycle, being able to be launched and updated independently, while remaining integrated into the unified experience of the main site.

The integration between modules will be asynchronous and transparent to the user. For example, we can use micro-frontend concepts to load each module separately, without the user noticing abrupt transitions between one module and another.

It is important to note that, although modular, the site should not "look" modular to the end user. There will be a consistent visual identity and navigation across all modules, ensuring a cohesive look and feel. We can adopt a unified design system (shared component library) so that buttons, typography, colors, and layout are homogeneous throughout the site, regardless of the module.

## 3. Hosting and Domain (Deploy Infrastructure)

The preferred hosting platform is GitHub (GH), possibly using GitHub Pages to host the site's front-end. GitHub Pages offers free hosting of static sites directly from a repository.

- **Custom domain:** We can configure a custom domain (e.g., educacaomedica.com) pointing to Pages.
- **Limitations and solutions for dynamic content:** GitHub Pages only serves static content. However, our project includes interactivity and possibly backend functionality. To get around this, we have a few options:
    - Use third-party APIs or serverless functions for the dynamic parts.
    - Host the site on a platform that supports backend, such as Vercel or Netlify, connected to the GitHub repository.
    - Use GitHub Codespaces or GitHub Codespace CLI to temporarily run instances with a backend when necessary.

## 4. Frontend Technologies (Framework Choice)

The recommended choice for the frontend is Next.js, built on React. Next.js is a popular and mature framework for web development.

- **Hybrid Rendering:** Supports both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) and embedded API routes.
- **Simple file-system routing:** Facilitates the creation of new pages/modules just by adding files or folders.
- **Integration with React and libraries:** We can take advantage of the multitude of existing React components for graphics, video players, medical content viewers, etc.
- **Optimized images and performance:** Next.js has automatic image optimization and code splitting.

SvelteKit is another strong candidate, which has the advantage of generating highly performant applications by compiling Svelte components into pure JS.

Given that the user indicated "the best" technology without explicit preference, Next.js will be recommended for its robustness and community, but with an openness to using SvelteKit in specific modules if its native performance brings benefits.

## 5. Backend: Python (FastAPI) for APIs and AI Logic

The chosen option for the backend is Python, and an excellent tool in this ecosystem for creating modern web APIs is FastAPI.

- **Performance and Concurrency:** Built on ASGI/Starlette, FastAPI is capable of handling a large number of requests asynchronously.
- **Ease of Development:** Uses Python type hints to automatically validate inputs and generate interactive documentation (Swagger UI) for the APIs.
- **Production-ready:** FastAPI is production-ready and supports easy scaling.

In the context of our project, the Python/FastAPI backend will likely have two main roles:

1.  Serve as an interface for AI functionalities and data processing.
2.  Provide support for interactive features of the site (outside the scope of just AI).

- **Backend Hosting:** The backend cannot run on GitHub Pages. Thus, we plan to containerize the FastAPI application (using Docker) and deploy it in a cloud infrastructure. We can use a service with a free tier, such as Railway, Fly.io, or Deta Space, or even a small EC2 server on AWS via the free tier.

## 6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligent Automation Integration

A key differentiator of this project is the extensive use of cutting-edge AI both behind the scenes (to help with content creation and evolution) and in the interface (to offer interactive educational functionalities).

- **LLM Collaboration: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro CLI and OpenAI GPT-5:** We intend to use two of the latest generation natural language models. The central idea is to create a "cooperation loop" between the LLMs, where one tool feeds the other and vice versa.
- **Open-Source Models (Mistral 7B, OpenAI Open Models) and Local Fine-Tuning:** To make the project sustainable and maximize the free use of AI, we will intensively explore available open-source models.
- **AI Applications in Medical Education and Other Models:** In addition to language models, the project also aims to include AI focused on other types of medical data, to address the note: "teach deeply another model not specifically of language, but of medicine".

## 7. Interactive and Multimedia Content

To engage adult doctors in advanced learning, the content cannot be just long text. Therefore, our site will be multimedia and interactive, combining different pedagogical formats:

- **High-quality text:** There will be articles, explanations, and written clinical cases, but written concisely and supported by AI to ensure clarity.
- **Images and Illustrations:** The visual content will be abundant. It will include medical graphics, anatomical schemes, conduct flowcharts, etc.
- **Videos and Animations:** Whenever possible, we will include explanatory videos or practical demonstrations.
- **Simulations and Interactive Tools:** This is a strong point â€“ creating practical experiences. We can develop clinical case simulators.
- **Assessments and Gamification:** Each module may contain multiple-choice quizzes, drag-and-drop questions, image identification, etc.

## 8. Deploy and Automation (CLI and Integrated CI/CD)

To maintain an agile and reliable development flow, we will implement a deploy automation scheme combining custom CLI tools and CI/CD pipelines (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery).

- **Custom CLI Tool:** We can develop a small CLI utility (e.g., a Python or shell script) to facilitate recurring project tasks.
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD):** Each push or merge to the repository can trigger automated workflows.
- **Integration of AI agents in CI:** A really advanced step will be to use GPT-5 and the Gemini CLI within the pipelines, for automated QA (Quality Assurance) tasks.

## 9. Licensing and Distribution Model (Freemium)

As for the distribution of content and code, we will adopt a freemium strategy, that is, a significant part of the platform will be freely accessible (free) to attract users and fulfill the broad educational purpose, while advanced features or additional services will be available through payment or premium subscription, ensuring financial sustainability.

- **Open-Source Code and Infrastructure:** We will possibly make the site's code and automations open source under a permissive license (MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL, to be decided).
- **Free vs. Paid Content:** The platform will offer free access to the basic modules and main contents of each subject.
- **Monetization and Sustainability:** The freemium model allows a large base of users to obtain value for free, while a percentage converts to paid, guaranteeing revenue.
- **Access control and security:** We will implement a login and user management system on the backend to differentiate free and premium users.
