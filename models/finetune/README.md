# MEGA Fine-tuning Infrastructure

This directory contains tools and scripts for fine-tuning large language models specifically for medical education content generation.

## Overview

Fine-tuning allows us to specialize general-purpose language models for the specific domain of medical education, improving:
- **Accuracy**: Better understanding of medical terminology and concepts
- **Relevance**: More contextually appropriate educational content
- **Safety**: Reduced hallucination in medical contexts
- **Efficiency**: Better performance with fewer resources

## Current Status

⚠️ **This is placeholder infrastructure**

The scripts in this directory are currently placeholders for future development. Real fine-tuning will be implemented in Phase 4 of the roadmap (v0.5.0).

## Prerequisites

When fully implemented, this will require:
- CUDA-capable GPU with 16GB+ VRAM
- Python 3.8+ with PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Large medical text corpus for training

## Planned Features

### Dataset Preparation
- Medical literature ingestion
- Clinical case extraction
- Quality filtering and validation
- Data deduplication
- Privacy-preserving anonymization

### Model Training
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning
- Medical domain-specific evaluation metrics
- Multi-task learning for various medical specialties
- Distributed training support

### Model Evaluation
- Medical accuracy benchmarks
- Safety and hallucination testing
- Clinical relevance scoring
- A/B testing framework

## Usage (Future)

### Dataset Preparation
```bash
python prepare_dataset.py \
  --input_dir datasets/raw/ \
  --output_dir datasets/processed/ \
  --specialty cardiology \
  --split_ratio 0.8,0.1,0.1
```

### Fine-tuning
```bash
python train_lora.py \
  --base_model microsoft/DialoGPT-medium \
  --dataset datasets/processed/cardiology \
  --output_dir outputs/cardiology-lora \
  --epochs 3 \
  --learning_rate 1e-4
```

### Evaluation
```bash
python evaluate_model.py \
  --model outputs/cardiology-lora \
  --test_set datasets/processed/cardiology/test.json \
  --metrics accuracy,relevance,safety
```

## Integration with MEGA

Fine-tuned models will integrate with the LLM Orchestrator to provide:
- Domain-specific content generation
- Improved educational explanations  
- Contextually aware quiz questions
- Personalized learning pathways

## Compliance and Ethics

Medical AI systems require special consideration for:
- **Accuracy**: Misinformation can be harmful
- **Bias**: Fair representation across demographics
- **Transparency**: Explainable AI decisions
- **Privacy**: Patient data protection
- **Regulatory**: FDA/CE marking requirements

## Contributing

When this infrastructure is active:
1. Medical experts validate training data
2. MLOps engineers manage infrastructure
3. Software engineers integrate models
4. QA specialists test safety and accuracy
